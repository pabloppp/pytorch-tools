total_epochs = 20
base_scheduler = optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, delay_epochs) # delay the scheduler for 10 steps
delayed_scheduler = DelayerScheduler(optimizer, total_epochs - delay_epochs, base_scheduler)

for epoch in range(total_epochs):
	# train(...)
	delayed_scheduler.step()

	# The lr will be 0.001 for the first 10 epochs, then will use the policy fro the base_scheduler for the rest of the epochs


# for a base DelayerScheduler + CosineAnnealingLR you can just do:
#
# from torchtools.lr_scheduler import DelayedCosineAnnealingLR
# scheduler = DelayedCosineAnnealingLR(optimizer, delay_epochs, cosine_annealing_epochs) # the sum of both must be the total number of epochs
```

## Activations

### Mish
Original implementation: https://github.com/digantamisra98/Mish  
Original Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08681v1  
Implementation taken as is from https://github.com/lessw2020/mish  

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import Mish

# Then you can just use Mish as a replacement for any activation function, like ReLU
```

### AliasFreeActivation
Implementation based on https://github.com/rosinality/alias-free-gan-pytorch/blob/main/model.py#L225 by Rosinality
I modularized this activation so it can be easily used inside of any model without having to deal with complex initialization.

This activation actually takes a lot of responsibility, since it internally defines the channels and size of the input based on a set of parameters, instead of receiving them as a parameter, this means that the rest of the layers (convolutions, positional embedding, etc...) must adapt to it.

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn.alias_free_activation import AliasFreeActivation
from torchtools.nn import EqualLeakyReLU

# We can use the static function to get the filter parameters for a specific level. 
# It can be specially usefull to obtain the initial size and channels.
max_size, max_channels = 256, 512
first_channels, first_size = AliasFreeActivation.alias_level_params(
	0, max_levels=14, max_size=max_size, max_channels=max_channels
)[-2:]

class MyModel(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self, level, max_levels=14, max_size=256, max_channels=512, margin=10):
		...
		# AdaIN will require the style vector to be 2*size
		leaky_relu = EqualLeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
		self.activation = AliasFreeActivation(
			leaky_relu, level, max_levels=max_levels, max_size=max_size, max_channels=max_channels, margin=margin
		)
		self.conv = nn.Conv2d(self.activation.channels_prev, self.activation.channels, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
		...
	
	def forward(self, x): # x the channels and size of X are dependent on  the level of this module.
		...
		x = self.conv(x)
		x = self.activation(x)
		...

```

## Layers

### SimpleSelfAttention
Implementation taken as is from https://github.com/sdoria/SimpleSelfAttention

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import SimpleSelfAttention

# The input of the layer has to at least have 3 dimensions (B, C, N), 
# the attention will be performed in the 2nd dimension.
# 
# For images, the input will be internally reshaped to 3 dimensions,
# and reshaped back to the original shape before returning it
```

### PixelNorm
Inspired from https://github.com/github-pengge/PyTorch-progressive_growing_of_gans

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import PixelNorm

model = nn.Linear(
	nn.Conv2d(...),
	PixelNorm(),
	nn.ReLU()
)

# It doesn't require any parameter, it just performs a simple element-wise normalization
# x / torch.sqrt(torch.mean(x ** 2, dim=1, keepdim=True) + 1e-8)
#
# Just use it as a regular layer, generally after convolutions and before ReLU
# (warning) since it performs a srtq root it's pretty slow if the layer sizes are big
```

### Adaptive Instance Normalization - AdaIN
Implementation based on https://github.com/SiskonEmilia/StyleGAN-PyTorch  
Original Paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868  

Example of use:  
```python
from torchtools.nn import AdaIN

class MyModel(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self, n_channels):
		...
		# AdaIN will require the style vector to be 2*size
		self.style = nn.Linear(input_size, output_size*2) 
		self.adain = AdaIN(output_size)
		...
	
	def forward(self, x, w):
		...
		x = self.adain(x, self.style(w))
		...

# AdaIN will "transfer" a style encoded in a latent vector w into any tensor x.
# In order to do this it first needs to be passed through a linear layer that will return 2 tensors (actually, one tensor of twice the size required, that we'll then split in 2)
# It will then perform an instance normalization to "whiten" the tensor, followed with a de-normalization but using the values generated by the linear layer, thus encoding the original vector w in the tensor.
```

### EvoNorm
Implementation taken as is from https://github.com/digantamisra98/EvoNorm all credit goes to digantamisra98
Original Paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02967

Example of use:  
```python
from torchtools.nn import EvoNorm2D

model = nn.Linear(
	nn.Conv2d(...),
	EvoNorm2D(c_hidden), # For S0 version 
	# evoB0 = EvoNorm2D(input, affine = True, version = 'B0', training = True) # For B0 version
	nn.ReLU()
)
```

### GPT Transformer Encoder Layer
Implementation based on MinGPT https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT by Andrej Karpathy

It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the `torch.nn.TransformerEncoderLayer`

Example of use: 
```python
from torchtools.nn import GPTTransformerEncoderLayer

class MyTransformer(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self, n_channels):
		...
		encoder_layer = GPTTransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=512, nhead=8)
		self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=6)
		...

```

### Stylegan2 ModulatedConv2d
Implementation based on https://github.com/rosinality/alias-free-gan-pytorch/blob/main/model.py#L143 by Rosinality

It extends from `torch.nn.Conv2d` so you can use it as a drop-in replacement, the only Conv2d parámeter that you cannot use is 'groups' since it will be overriden for this to work.

It also includes a parameter `ema_decay` that will add the EMA normalization used in Alias-free GAN (defaults to 1, meaning that it's disabled)

Example of use: 
```python
from torchtools.nn import ModulatedConv2d

class MyModel(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self):
		...
		self.conv = ModulatedConv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1) 
		# SUGESTIONS: 
		#   set bias=False if you want to handle bias on your own
		#   set demodulate=False for RGB output
		#   set ema_decay=0.9989 to imitate the alias-free gan setup
		...

	def forward(self, x, w):
		...
		x = self.conv(x, w) # 'x' is a 4D tensor (B x C x W x H) and 'w' is a 2D tensor (B x C)
		...
```

### Equal Layers (EqualNorm, EqualLinear)
Implementation based on https://github.com/rosinality/alias-free-gan-pytorch/blob/main/stylegan2/model.py#L94

It extends the base classes (nn.Linear, nn.Conv2d, nn.LeakyReLU) so you can use this as a drop-in replacement, although it includes some optiona parameters.

Example of use: 
```python
from torchtools.nn import EqualLinear, EqualLeakyReLU, EqualConv2d

class MyModel(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self):
		...
		self.linear = EqualLinear(16, 32, bias_init=1, lr_mul=0.01) # bias_init and lr_mul are extra optional params
		self.leaky_relu = EqualLeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
		self.conv = EqualConv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
		# Since this classes extend from the base classes, you can use all parameters from the original classes.
		...

```

### FourierFeatures2d
Implementation inspired on https://github.com/rosinality/alias-free-gan-pytorch/blob/main/model.py#L88
but improved using my own understanding of how this should work...

It creates a 2d tensor of embeddings following a fourier series based on the parameters you provide, this features are dynamic, meaning that affine transformations can be applied to them in order to shift, rotate, and even scale (experimental).

```python
from torchtools.nn import EqualLinear, EqualLeakyReLU, EqualConv2d

class MyModel(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self, dim=256, margin=10, cutoff=2):
		...
		self.feats = FourierFeatures2d(4+margin*2, dim, cutoff) # optionally enable scaling with allow_scaling=True
		# Also, you can randomize the frequencies if you plan on keeping them fixed, setting w_scale to any value > 0
		...

	def forward(self, affine):
		...
		embds = self.feats(affine) # 'affine' should be a Bx4 tensor, or Bx6 if scaling is enabled...
		# the default or initial affine values should be [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1] => ([1, 0]: rotation, [0, 0]: shift, [1, 1]: scale)
		...

```



## Criterions

### Gradient Penalty (for WGAN-GP)
Implementation taken with minor changes from https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp  
Original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028.pdf

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import GPLoss
# This criterion defines the gradient penalty for WGAN GP
# For an example of a training cycle refer to this repo https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp/blob/master/gan_cifar10.py#L185

discriminator = ...
gpcriterion = GPLoss(discriminator) # l = 10 by default

gradient_penalty = gpcriterion(real_data, fake_data)
discriminator_loss = ... + gradient_penalty # add the gp component to the Wasserstein loss
```

### Total Variation Loss
Total Variation denoising https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Total_variation_denoising  

Example of use:
```python
# This loss (or regularization) is usefull for removing artifacts and noise in generated images.  
# It's widely used in style transfer.
from torchtools.nn import TVLoss

tvcriterion = TVLoss() # reduction = 'sum' and alpha = 1e-4 by default

G = ... # output image
tv_loss = tvcriterion(G)
loss = ... + tv_loss # add the tv loss component to your reconstruction loss
```


## Vector Quantization
### VectorQuantize: Encodding based quantization [(source)](torchtools/vq.py#L5)
This transforms any tensor to its quantized version using a codebook of embeddings.  
It uses a traight-forward approach for applying the gradients.  
Passing a tensor trough the **VectorQuantize** module will return a new tensor with the same dimension but changing each one of the tensors of the last dimension by the nearest neighbor from the codebook, which has a limited number of values, thus quantizing the tensor.

For the quantization it relies in a differentiable function that you can see [here](torchtools/functional/vq.py#L4)

The output of the model is a quantized tensor, as well as a Touple of the loss components of the codebook (needed for training), and the indices of the quantized vectors in the form: `qx, (vq_loss, commit_loss), indices`

When **creating a new instance of the module**, it accepts the following parameters: 
  - **embedding_size**: the size of the embeddings used in the codebook, should match the last dimension of the tensor you want to quantize
  - **k**: the size of the codebook, or number of embeddings. 
  - **ema_decay** (default=0.99): the Exponentially Moving Average decay used (this only will be used if ema_loss is True)
  - **ema_loss** (default=False): Enables Exponentially Moving Average update of the codebook (instead of relying on gradient descent as EMA converges faster) 

When **calling the forward method** of the module, it accepts the following parameters:
  - **x**: this is the tensor you want to quantize, make sure the dimension that you want to quantize (by default is the last one) matches embedding_size defined when instantiating the module
  - **get_losses** (default=True): when False, the vq_loss and commit_loss components of the output will both be None, this should speed up a little bit the model when used for inference.
  - **dim** (default=-1): The dimension across which the input should be quantized.

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import VectorQuantize

e = torch.randn(1, 16, 16, 8) # create a random tensor with 8 as its last dimension size
vquantizer = VectorQuantize(8, k=32, ema_loss=True) # we create the module with embedding size of 8, a codebook of size 32 and make the codebook update using EMA
qe, (vq_loss, commit_loss), indices = vquantizer.forward(e) # we quantize our tensor while also getting the loss components and the indices

# NOTE While the model is in training mode, the codebook will always be updated when calling the forward method, in order to freeze the codebook for inference put it in evaluation mode with 'vquantizer.eval()'

# NOTE 2 In order to update the module properly, add the loss components to the final model loss before calling backward(), if you set ema_loss to true you only need to add the commit_loss to the total loss, an it's usually multiplied by a value between 0.1 and 2, being 0.25 a good default value

loss = ... # whatever loss you have for your final output
loss += commit_loss * 0.25
# loss += vq_loss # only if you didn't set the ema_loss to True

...
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

```

--- 

### Binarize: binarize the input tensor [(source)](torchtools/vq.py#L55)
This transfors the values of a tensor into 0 and 1 depending if they're above or below a specified threshold.
It uses a traight-forward approach for applying the gradients, so it's effectively differentiable.

For the quantization it relies in a differentiable function that you can see [here](torchtools/functional/vq.py#L36)

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import Binarize

e = torch.randn(8, 16) # create a random tensor with any dimension

binarizer = Binarize(threshold=0.5) # you can set the threshold you want, for example if your output was passed through a tanh activation, 0 might be a better theshold since tanh outputs values between -1 and 1

bq = binarizer(e) # will return a tensor with the same shape as e, but full of 0s and 1s
```

## Embeddings

### RotaryEmbedding
Implementation taken as is from https://github.com/lucidrains/x-transformers/blob/main/x_transformers/x_transformers.py#L161

Example of use:
```python
from torchtools.nn import RotaryEmbedding

class MyModel(nn.Module):
	def __init__(self, dim):
		...
		self.rotary_pos_embd =  RotaryEmbedding(dim)
		...
	
	def forward(self, x):
		x = self.rotary_pos_embd(x)
		...


```

## Diffusion

### Diffuzz
Custom (non-cached) continuous forward/backward diffusion.
It's not SUPER performant since it calculates all the required values on the fly instead of caching them (although I add a very simple cache where you can specify the number of steps that you want to cache), but in general I think this will not make an extremely big difference in terms of performance, simplifies a lot the code, and removes the concept of having a fixed number of timesteps for the forward diffusion (since I always found it weird to train a model assuming 1000 forward diffusion steps, and then using way less steps during inference) by using a continuous value between 0 and 1 to decide how much noise we'll be adding to the output (1 being pure gaussian noise).

During sampling, the same applies, instead of having a fixed number of steps, the diffuzz module will accept a noised input, a couple of values t & t_prev (between 0 and 1) and a predicted noise, and it will try to remove such noise in a scale such as to go from step t to step t_prev, so if we want to denoise in 10 steps we'll tell it to go from 1.0 to 0.9, then to 0.8, etc... while if we want to denoise in 100 steps, we'll start at 1.0 and go to 0.99, then to 0.98, etc... 

Example of use during training:
```python
from torchtools.utils import Diffuzz
device = "cuda"

diffuzz = Diffuzz(device=device)
# diffuzz = Diffuzz(device=device, cache_steps=10000) # optionally you can pass a 'cache_steps' parameter to speed up the noising process
custom_unet = CustomUnet().to(device) # Custom model whith output size = input size

input_tensor = torch.randn(8, 3, 16, 16, device=device) # an image, audio signal, or whatever...

t = torch.rand(input_tensor.size(0), device=device) # get a tensor with batch_size of values between 0 and 1
noised_tensor, noise = diffuzz.diffuse(input_tensor, t)

predicted_noise = custom_unet(noised_tensor, t)
loss = nn.functional.mse_loss(predicted_noise, noise)

# Optionally the diffuzz module provides loss gamma weighting (untested) but for this to work the loss 
# should not be averaged on the batch dimension before applying it.

# loss = nn.functional.mse_loss(predicted_noise, noise, reduction='none').mean(dim=[1, 2, 3])
# loss = (loss * diffuzz.p2_weight(t)).mean()

```

Example of use for sampling:
```python
from torchtools.utils import Diffuzz
device = "cuda"

sampled = diffuzz.sample(
	custom_unet, {'c': conditioning}, 
	(conditioning.size(0), 3, 16, 16),
	timesteps=20, sampler='ddim'
)[-1]
```

the `sample` method accepts a `sampler` parameter, currently only `ddpm` (default) and `ddim` are implemented, but I'm planning on adding more, very likely by borrowing (and appropriately citing) code from this repo https://github.com/ozanciga/diffusion-for-beginners
